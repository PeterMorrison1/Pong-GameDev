# COVID-19 Pong Mod
Each groupmate made a mod for pong, the general theme was to make the player laugh through references to current events and nostalgia (from old games), as well as have fun with interesting gameplay with the score events mod. Finally two of the mods were for rounding out the game so it can have a start and end screen. More detailed descriptions are below.

## Main Menu - Peter Morrison
The main menu mod improves gameplay by providing users with time to see what the title is, choose when to start the game (rather than the game instantly starting), and allows the user to enter their name for personalization.

## End Screen - Jamie Wong
The end screen modification provices users with an end point to the game, once reaching a certain score. The end screen provides users with the final score count, game message and allows the user to restart the game. 

## Score Events - Ralph Acusar
When the player or the opponent reaches the score of 5, the ball will traverse faster. The next score milestone event occurs at 10 where two balls will be in play. These milestones provide the player an increased challenge that will enhance their experience when scoring the ball.

## Visuals - Leris Arandia
Visual modifications, such as to the paddles, ball, and changing backgrounds, give the game a more coherent theme. It makes it more than just a basic game of pong, with gray objects across the screen. Bright visuals make the gameplay more enjoyable and immersive.

## Audio - Yuna Song
The audio modification improves gameplay by providing the users with sound effects while playing the game. It also allows them to indulge in their childhood memory along with references to current events in the world.
