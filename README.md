# COVID-19 Pong Mod

# Mods

## Main Menu
The main menu mod improves gameplay by providing users with time to see what the title is, choose when to start the game (rather than the game instantly starting), and allows the user to enter their name for personalization.

## End Screen


## Random Barriers Spawning


## Visuals
Visual modifications, such as to the paddles, ball, and changing backgrounds, give the game a more coherent theme. It makes it more than just a basic game of pong, with gray objects across the screen. Bright visuals make the gameplay more enjoyable and immersive.

## Audio
The audio modification improves gameplay by providing the users with sound effects while playing the game. It also allows them to indulge in their childhood memory along with references to current events in the world.
